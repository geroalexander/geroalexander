## Hello friend 👋. I'm Gero, a JavaScript developer.

I come from a hospitality background where the lack of technological innovation within the industry led me to make the jump to programming. Ultimately I wanted to build solutions rather than just wish for them, giving me the oppertunity to explore my creative side.

When I'm not coding I love to surf 🏄‍♂️ and read up on the lastest SpaceX news 🚀.

### What I'm Doing

- 🌱 I love using the command line and want to level up my linux skills. Currently learning bash scripting and going on from there!
